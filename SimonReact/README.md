### Goal
###### To re-create the Simon memory game created by Milton Bradley in 1978 as a mobile app that can run on both Android and IOS.  I tried to make the game feel as authentic as possible.

### Technologies used:

###### React Native
###### React
###### JSX
###### Javascript
###### XCode

### Description

###### I created this app with the goal of teaching myself React Native.  I had never used either React or React Native so this was a significant challenge.  Throughout the process i learned a ton about React Native, and how React differs from Angular which is another popular front-end Javascript framework.  It was interesting to see the different approaches to solving similar problems.
