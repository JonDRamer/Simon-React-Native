### Goal
###### To re-create the Simon memory game created by Milton Bradley in 1978 as a mobile app that can run on both Android and IOS.  I tried to make the game feel as authentic as possible.

### Technologies used:

###### React Native
###### React
###### JSX
###### Javascript
###### XCode

### Description

###### I created a simple Simon memory game that runs on both IOS and Android. It's a clone of the original Simon game that Milton Bradley produced in 1978.

### Challenge

###### I was given one week to teach myself React Native and make an app with it.  I had never used React much less React Native before so this was a significant challenge.

### Key Takeaways

###### Throughout the process of creating this app I learned a ton about React Native, and how React differs from Angular which is another popular front-end Javascript framework.  It was interesting to see the different approaches to solving similar problems. I also learned that styling in React Native is really restrictive.  It makes sense that it would be because the code compiles down to either C for IOS of Java for Android. That means whatever styles you're applying have to work in two completely different environments so it's understandable. You don't apply styles with CSS in React Native. React Native has it's own library of styles that you can choose from. They are similar to, but not the same as their CSS equivalents. What React Native allows you to do with Javascript is incredibly powerful. The fact that you can make apps that run on both IOS and Android in pure javascript is amazing.
